                    wlanpoke To Do and History


To Do:

2021-04-06.02	Enh: Implement threshold for Gaps report to ignore just 1 (or 2) missed ping(s).
					This would eliminate the inconsequential 1 ping outages.

2021-04-02.09	Enh: Limit potential out of control /etc/log/fping.txt.log.
					-> need to use the logfile rotation to do this, not now

2021-03-30.04	Enh: rename "quick" and "slow" web server options.
					-> minimal and full? not really. quick is ok. ...

2021-03-27.03   Enh: add option to suppress re-launching wpa_cli or at least delay it.

2021-03-26.03   Enh: change messages log file location to /etc/log for persistence over a reboot.
                    Alt: copy messages* after a full reset.

2020.09.17.10   Enh: Sanity check for configured options.
                    -> do not specify -w quick, causes rapid loop, hard to break.

2020.09.17.09   Enh: Improve CheckVal to at least reject -options as values.



History:


0.8.4.1 04/06/2021

2021-04-07.01	Bug: mostly blank statistic web page without -d /etc/log/ command line option.
					-> awstats.sh Version="0.1.7 4/7/2021"
					-> '| grep "\-d"' restored, was inadvertently deleted

2021-04-06.01	Enh: Report of recent reset a la Gaps report.
					-> Resets report same as Gaps, but of resets. Easy.

0.8.4.0 04/05/2021

2021-04-03.04	Enh: record vector of recent outages in seconds in seconds.
					-> include the current - or + setting as first item in report, e.g.
					Add the current status and report timestamp to the GapList report to allow calculating the clock time of each outage. To compute the elapsed seconds to an entry, add the absolute values of the numbers to that entry, then subtract that from the report time.

0.8.3.5 04/03/2021


2021-04-03.02	Enh: include unix time 'uxtime' at launch, certain messages, or use to calculate elapsed seconds.
					Would be nice to have kernel elapsed time (uptime?) as well...
					-> done. New tu* variables measure last connection outage and working times for reports.

2021-04-03.03	Enh: Do not reset FullFails on successive resets so the FullFails counter is more accurate
					However, it does not include the sleep delays of additional resets, 
						so it should be adjusted to predict the number of failures that would have occurred.
					CXL: No, that is not the same. The subsequent resets create new situations. 
						 The new situation results indicates the latest condition of the link.

2021-04-03.01	Enh: include last RawFails value in step line of RawFails report!
					-> done.


0.8.3.4 04/02/2021

2021-04-02.07	Enh: Replace hyphen with space in "    Qr:0 Fr:3 - Wr:4 Wc:0, "
					-> done

2021-04-02.02	Enh: RawFails: change (slow) to complete launch command line.
					-> Options=${psEntry##*.sh } but should have this in Version file.
					"slow" is the recongnized result, and the name is changing, anyway.

2021-04-02.05	Enh: RawFails: remove path '/etc/wlanpoke/' from version string.
					-> ${0##*/} removes up to the last '/'

2021-04-02.03	Enh: RawFails: change launch date "Thu Apr 1 16:24:22 EDT 2021" to "R 2021-04-01_16:24:22-0400" or "Thu" or no dow
					-> Version file changed to uniform time stamp, used by RawFails

2021-04-02.06	Enh: RawFails: change "Logging to" to "Logs:"
					echo $VersWLP "logs:" $LOGDIR

2021-04-02.03	Enh: RawFails: change 2nd line timestamp a la 2021-04-02.03
					echo `date -Isecs` "(" `uptime` ")"

2021-04-02.01	Enh: Radically shorten "Recovery or reset by hold off seconds:" and add current step:seconds.
					echo "Step $FRstStep, limit:results: [ $SSout ] wlan: $(echo $LASTSTAT | awk '{print $2,$8,$10,$17}')" >> $FPINGLOG
					-> seconds not added (too much info)

2021-04-02.08	Bug: Missing console message title.
					echo "Hold-off step $j was $FRstStep"	# fix message


0.8.3.1 04/01/2021

2021-04-01.02	Enh: Conditional function declaration to change timestamp formatting.
					Do not want conditionals to slow down simple function that echos for output capture, e.g.,
					TimeFmt=":"   # ":" for HH:MM:SS, "-" for HH-MM-SS, otherwise specified 'date' format, e.g., "-Isec" (0.8.3.1)

2021-04-01.01	Enh: RawFails report is missing signal level, current step.
					-> current value added
					-> <=25 secs older than current RawFails into fping.txt

2021-04-01.03	Enh: Trap or handle any shell math errors, now cause script to exit.
					These are bugs, but what about that "line 1" ?
					/etc/wlanpoke/wlanpoke.sh: line 1: arithmetic syntax error
					Only the EXIT handler is called. see badmath.sh. Give up for now.
					Consider reverting to let ... instead of $(( ... )) for math in functions.
					-> HOLD. Fix the bugs instead. Revisit if a disaster.

0.8.3.0 03/31/2021


2021-03-31.01   Enh: eliminate +/-XXXX time zone from time stamps, except at sign on.
					-> new function Date populates globals $DateTZ $DateTS $Date_S, using $Date_S

2021-03-30.03   Enh: Reset PID when relaunching wpa_cli via full reset so not reported as changed.
					-> wpa_cli_PID=`pidof wpa_cli`	# don't count our restart as an external restart.

2021-03-30.02   Enh: Add method to analyze the current hold off step to see whether it can be reduced.
					Currently, the step increments but never decrements.
					A lengthy network outage (router reboot) would increment the step to the max, which would then wait the maximum time before resetting the radio during a wireless outage.

					FRstWait_calculate $FullFails
					-> NO: If the step is >0, OK: get the last reset recovery time
					   Increase the time by the step percentage or 40% or add a "safety factor," YES: perhaps 3?
					   Find the lowest step value that is >= that value.
					   set the step to the corresponding index.

2021-03-31.02   Bug: last reset #3 had no recovery entry
					fails 21 Ping 2s-1q6f Evants, Fails[0..21]: Qr:0 Fr:3 Wr:1 Wc:3, [ 16969 18 2 1 0 0 0 0 21:1 ] Recovery or reset by hold off seconds: 12:12, 18:18, 26:0, 37: 53: 75: 106:
					Should have been 26:21, not 26:0. There was an entry, just not the right one.
					-> increment entry by FRstStep not FRstCount

0.8.2.0 03/30/2021

2021-03-30.01   Bug: remove deprecated command line options:
                    " -w * wait seconds for ping to succeed (default $PINGWAIT)"        # 0.8.2.2: deprecated, removed
                    " -vt  enable verbose tcp logging of link quality statistics (default $TSTSTATS)"       # 0.8.2.2: deprecated, removed

2021-03-29.01   Bug: Handle two gateways for eth0 and eth1
                    GATEWAY=`netstat -r -n | grep ^0.0.0.0 | cut -f2 | awk '{print $2}'` | cut -d' ' -f1    # may be 2 gateways eth0 and eth1

2020.09.17.05   Fnc: Test and handle Ethernet cable attachment and disconnect.
                    -> Reinstated. was canceled 0.7.5: radio stays on wireless even when Ethernet cable is attached unless selected from UI
                    -> If the radio is configured for Ethernet, stop resetting the wireless.
                    -> too bad the wireless and Ethernet adapters use the same MAC address....
                    cat /etc/network/interfaces | grep "auto eth" | cut -f2
                    AutoIFace_check ; if AutoIFace_isWLAN ; then echo -n wlan ; else echo -n Ethernet ; fi ; wpa_cli_status ; echo " ${AutoIFace##auto} $WpaST"
                    auto eth0
                    auto eth1=XXXXXX
                    -> done.

2021-03-26.02   Enh: monitor wpa_supplicant a la wpa_cli and write log entry for changed PID, but what about relaunch if missing?
                    -> FailedPings_inc $PING_WPA_PID        # new slot...

2021-03-27.02   Enh: log count of changed wpa_cli PIDs -- can use array [11] after wpa_cli restarts
                    -> done, see 2021-03-26.02

2021-03-27.05   Fnc: does is the wpa_cli status show a fault when the system fails?
                    -> WpaST=$(wpa_cli status | grep -e wpa_state -e ip_add | cut -d '=' -f2 | awk '{printf("%s ",$0);}')
                    -> added to various report strings.

2021-03-29.02   Enh: Calculate SleepStep Seconds array according to new variable WaitStepPct, percentage to increase hold off wait time.
                    -> done. Default percent is 40%

2021-03-29.03   Enh: clean up FailedPings array slot definitions, a confusing mess.
                    -> done.

2021-03-29.01   Enh: replace let with shell math functions
                    -> done.


2021-03-28.01   Fnc: Calculate SleepStep Seconds array according to FMult,FDiv, etc.
                    -> CXL. use percentage, see 2021-03-29.02

2021-03-26.05   Enh: add logfile 'ping' to log that script is still running.
                    -> CXL, just don't sleep as long, switched to hold off activity delay.

2021-03-27.04   Fnc: Improve hold off to not hold off the script, but rather delay subsequent full resets for the indicated time.
                    -> Renamed failed ping count "nF" was 'n', too confusing.
                    -> FRstSleep is increased only if FRstCount -gt 0
                    -> Keep failed ping counter 'n' counting for statistics, up to the largest number 'let' can handle, or some other limit.
                    -> Full reset trigger is nF -eq NextFull. NextFull=n+FRstSleep/PINGSECS
                        Quick reset is used only with low failed pings 'n', as now.
                    -> FRstSleep minimum value is the PINGRESET*PINGSECS because built in 1..PINGRESET count no longer working.
                    -> report count of recoveries sparse matrix indexed by n        (outage indicator)
                    -> report: 15:3, 17:1, 18:1 ... appended to fpings entry.
                        e.g., 4 1 ... 0 0 10:2 11:2 44:2 55:1 98:1 99:3
                    -> use simple array of hold times indexed by the reset count.
                        # SleepStep Seconds: 12,18,27,40,60,90,120
                    -> report: prepended list of FullFails, indexed by SleepStep.
                        shows how close the system was to another reset when it recovered, or didn't
                        e.g., 12:16,10,12, 18:14,14,13, 27: 40: 60: 90: 120:

2021-03-16.03   Bug: 'quick' web server serves out of data pages.
                    -> CXL 'quick' server may become deprecated, although it uses less memory.


0.8.0.1 03/27/2021

2021-03-27.03   Enh: add signal level to web 'RawFails' reports
                    -> awstats.sh 0.1.6: LASTSTAT=`iwconfig eth1 | grep -E -i 'Rate|Quality|excessive'`
                    LASTSTAT=$(echo $LASTSTAT | awk '{print $2,$8,$10,$17}') ; echo `date` "(" `uptime` ")" $LASTSTAT

2021-03-27.01   Bug: Hey! the size of 0.0.0.0 is 7, not 6! And wc -c 0.0.0.0 returns 8 (extra \n)
                    -> change to -le 8 was 7

2021-03-26.12   Enh: Handle long delays in wlan stop and wlan start
                    -> need to add additional logger to /etc/init.d/wlan


0.8.0.0 03/26/2021

2021-03-26.09   Enh: Hold off resetting until after the first ping succeeds to allow user to change networks.
                    -> PingOk=0  counts ok pings to hold off initial reset until a connection is established

2021-03-26.08   Enh: implement hard reset delay backoff.
                    FRstSleepMin=1          # minimum time to hold off after a full reset.
                    FRstSleepMax=120        # maximum time to hold off another full reset after a previous unsuccessful one.
                    FRstSleep=1             # number of seconds to sleep after a full reset. (0.8.0.0)
                    FRstCount=0             # count of current full resets, reset when ping succeeds (0.8.0.0)
                    FRMult=5                # let FRstSleep=1+FRstSleep*FRMult/FRDiv (0.8.0.0)
                    FRDiv=4                 # let FRstSleep=1+FRstSleep*FRMult/FRDiv (0.8.0.0)

2021-03-26.13   Enh: Handle long delays in udhcpc launch.
                    -> kill any remaining udhcpc before sleeping. Above stop also takes time.
                    killall udhcpc  # why is it taking so long to start udhcpc?

2021-03-26.07   Enh: log timing on all reset functions for timing analysis.
                    Log_addDateTime() adds timestamp, RadioName, LastIP, Version, etc., to new global ADTmsg, then logs and echos.

2021-03-26.11   Bug: Invalidate gateway 0.0.0.0, which will give a successful ping result!
                    # echo 0.0.0.0 | wc -c      -> 8 not 7 because of the \n

2021-03-26.10   Fnc: Don't clutter logs with endless Failed and Recovered Gateway messages
                    -> iGWFails counter to control logging

2021-03-26.06   Enh: trap any kill or exit conditions to log script exiting.
                    -> done. trap Script_exit EXIT     # call Script_exit() if we are exiting for any reason.
                    NOTE: kill -9 will not execute the EXIT trap before exiting.

2021-03-26.09   Enh: log script exits. do something if we are exiting (but no auto restart...)
                    New function Script_exit() tries to save logs, etc.

2021-03-26.01   Enh: Previous fping.txt lost after relaunch. It would be nice to have add fping.txt to fping.log with a timestamp upon launch.
                    -> Done. Save any the previous fpings.txt to a 'log' file

2021-03-21.01   Bug: 2 complaints of the script not working every time (loses connection)
                    -> The ResetQuick function requires signaling the udhcpc client to renew the ip address, which is handled by the wpa_cli program running in the background. However, in 4 of 7 radios here, wpa_cli was not running, which meant no lease renewal after reassociation, which was necessary to keep jive happy.
                    -> ACTIVE, hopefully fixed in 0.7.5 or 0.7.4, wait for reports.
                    -> WORKAROUND: disable quick reset with -Q 7 option, or -F 3 option.
                    -> 0.7.6: default changed to 7.

2021-03-25.01   Bug: partially functional gateway test to detect changing networks is falsely triggered causing script to stop mitigation.
                    -> Caused by delayed or interrupted recovery coinciding with infrequent gateway test.
                    -> The gateway test should not change the existing ip address or gateway until another valid gateway and ip address is obtained.
                    -> A failed gateway test should not interrupt the periodic full recovery mechanism.
                    Pointless Dhcp_renew() not called, but function kept for possible future use.


2021-03-26.04   Bug: delete unnecessary call to wpa_cli_check from ResetQuick to clean up code.
                    -> Done. This is done in main loop just before this call, and is defined later...

0.7.6 03/24/2021

2021-03-25.04   Enh: Support automatic log folder detection by uplogs.sh.
                    -> done a la awstats.sh

2021-03-25.03   Fnc: Support automatic log folder detection by web pages, e.g., awstats.sh
                    -> awstats.sh now derives the log folder from the wlanpoke command line, and reports the folder.
                    -> it now shows the host name in the web page title.

2021-03-25.02   Fnc: Change script defaults to disable ResetQuick unless specifically configured.
                    -> PINGQUICK=7  was 3. Disable when not testing.


0.7.5 03/24/2021


2021-03-24.03   Fnc: Add 'last resort' dhcpc lease renewal request in the case of persistent lack of valid ip or gateway
                    ->done

2021-03-24.02   Fnc: remove gratuitous dhcpc lease renewal request from ResetQuick, as it occurs before the reassociation, not after.
                    -> done, and previous references to removed if down / up calls.

2021-03-24.02   Fnc: move wpa_cli_check to be called before every ping test, very frequently.
                    -> done. check this to see when the wpa_cli quits. If before the network is lost, that's important to know.
                    -> can be moved to once every 10 tests after this determination
                    -> initial testing shows wpa_cli failing and now restarting, with no ping failure before or after.

2021-03-24.01   Fnc: remove unused FailedPings_getEntry
                    -> done.

2021-03-23.01   Fnc: mitigate the lack of wpa_cli running to handle wpa_actions.
                    -> new function wpa_cli_check() introduced to check that wpa_cli is running, and restart it if not.
                    The function logs restarts, plus cases in which the wpa_cli pid(s) have changed.
                    For now, this function is called only at the beginning of ResetQuick(). It could be called each ping test.
                    If ResetQuick is disabled, the hard reset will relaunch wpa_cli anyway.
                    Restarts and process ID changes and are logged locally and to the tcp logging server.
                    The function does not check to see the wpa_cli mode (i.e., -B -a), nor does it check whether multiple instances are running. An enhancement may be desirable.
                    The reason wpa_cli stops running is unknown, but it may have crashed. The recEvent utility shows messages stopping before a failure is detected, then resuming immediately after wpa_supplicant and wpa_client are killed, until the driver is unloaded.
                    -> The FailedPings array index after full resets, default [10], is used to store the count of times wpa_cli has been found missing and restarted.

2021-03-19.04   Bug: occasional web server hangs on RawPings access, everything else works.
                    -> CXL: cannot reproduce

2021-03-17.04   Enh: FailedPings vector is hard to read.
                Add some sort of indication to FailedPings vector to identify the quick, full, quickcount, and fullcount slots.
                See the example in manual.txt
                    -> HOLD: Takes 4 tests.... (if elif elif elif fi) ... too much for now.

2020.09.19.08   Enh: Support single and double quotes in log entries.
                    -> HOLD: too complex for now

2020.09.17.07   Enh: Automatically determine wlan interface (wlan0, eth1, etc.).
                    -> HOLD: eth1 seems hard coded in baby

2020.09.17.08   Enh: Use more robust method to determine squeezeplay radio name and LMS server ip.
                    -> CXL: not causing any trouble so far.

2020.09.17.06   Fnc: Test and handle AP or lan outages.
                    -> CXL: too hard to separate from wireless issues.

2020.09.17.05   Fnc: Test and handle ethernet cable attachment and disconnect.
                    -> CXL: radio stays on wireless even when Ethernet cable is attached unless selected from UI

0.7.4 03/22/2021

2021-03-21.03   Bug: "sh: 169: unknown operand" message launching before network fully up.
                    -> line 662 variable $IPFIRST missing quotes in comparison, fixed:

0.7.3 03/20/2021

2021-03-19.03   Fnc: rename gpl3.txt LICENSE.md to make GitHub happy.
                    -> done.

2021-03-19.02   Doc: document gs.bat and gs.sh
                    -> new "Customize gs.bat and Create gs.sh" manual.txt section

2021-03-20.01   Doc: change "github" to "GitHub"
                    -> 3 instances change in manual.txt

2021-03-19.01   Fnc: create batch file to request RawFiles. Let user adapt into a shell script.
                    -> gs.bat uses curl.

2021-03-19.01   Fnc: add "RawFiles" web service to awstats.sh to provide a failed pings summary report.
                    -> done -- returns 3 lines, could be shortened.

0.7.2 03/17/2021

2021-03-18.04   Enh: create shell script to upload logs to tftpd server.
                    -> very basic uplogs.sh created.

2020.09.29.03   Fnc: Evaluate: local log saves ping statistics on first ping fail,
                not sent to logging server, is this useful?
                    -> not so useful, really fills up the log files unnecessarily.
                    -> for now, log only the first failed ping, but not the history to save space.

2021-03-17.01   Enh: Improve the web status report, better process list, include version numbers
                    -> Initial host and version info, process list shows hierarchy, failed pings are separated

2021-03-17.02   Bug: Recovery report is not written to the log file, but is transmitted to ncat
                    -> elif [[ -r "$1" ]] ; then  # 0.7.2: was -f pass any file name, and if it can be read, cat it
                    -> Perhaps this is still not fixed...

2021-03-17.03   Enh: Separate the restart counters from the failed ping counters.
                    -> create 2 new slots after the maximum failed ping entry to hold the quick and full reset count.
                        PINGLFULL=$PINGLIST last entry  let "PINGLQUIK=PINGLFULL-1" next to last entry
                        FailedPings_inc $PINGLFULL  # don't interfere with the failed ping count.

2020.09.19.04   Fnc: Consider alternate app names to replace 'wlanpoke'.
                    -> too late now.

2021.02.23.03   Enh: new command line switches to replace the constant 'Restart Wait Seconds'
                    -> CXL, too obscure, and too many options as it is.

2020.09.29.04   Fnc: reset wireless if 169.154 auto configuration link local address continues for a period.
                    -> CXL, too rare, and beside the dhcp client should handle this, perhaps it does.

2020.09.21.04   Doc: Create new "technical notes" document(s) to document software and aid troubleshooting.
                    -> CSL: improved commenting and analysis section of manual.txt will have to do for now.

2020.09.29.02   Bug: software stops detecting disconnect after a period of time.

                     - nc was hung on 2 examined units, despite the -w 3 timeout argument.
                     - Perhaps something in the logging server hung it. But it should time out regardless.
                     - nc_txNoHang() launches in background, saves PID for nc_ckHang () to later kill...
                    -> CXL, cannot reproduce. Many updates since issue arose.

2020.09.20.01   Fnc: did.sh De-identification script to de-identify logs for contribution to public bug database.
                    -> CXL. An example is shown in manual.txt

2020.09.19.02   Enh: Add Battery and uptime to capture statistics.
                    -> CXL: not relevant to connectivity loss


0.7.1 03/16/2021

2021-03-16.05   Bug: Launching wlanpoke with the web server option multiple times caused program loops.
                    -> the busybox kill command does not accept the negative PID to kill a process and its dependents. Removed the '-' from $PID
                    -> ahttpd.sh: added killall cat to the killall nc stopgap measures

2021-03-16.04   Enh: Speed up the 'slow' web server, it is too slow.
                    -> rearranged the program flow to launch a response more quickly,
                    removed some unnecessary steps. Better.

2021-03-16.02   Bug: web server does not work correctly.
                    -> not setting the current directory to the installation folder, fixed.

2021-03-16.01   Bug: instructions do not handle non-flat zip files (e.g., from github) correctly
                    -> added additional steps and a note at the top of manual.txt


0.7.0 03/15/2021

2021-03-02.01   Enh: ash http server? This works:
                    while true; do (echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\nWLAN stats:" ; iwconfig eth1 ; /lib/atheros/wmiconfig --getTargetStats ; echo -e "\n" ;  tail -n 12 /var/log/wlanerr.log) | nc -lp 8080 | grep "User-Agent"; done &
                    - Implemented 'quick' and 'slow' optional server launched from wlanpoke or command prompt, consisting of 3 scripts.

2021.02.26.01   Enh: add a statistic for number of failed pings and longest ping failure for later transmission.
                    -> New functions FailedPings_clear(), FailedPings_getAll(), and FailedPings_inc()

2021-03-11.01   Enh: try faster reset after a shorter number of failures.
                    -Q * number of pings to fail before quick reset (default $PINGQUICK, disable > $PINGRESET)

2021.02.23.02   Enh: new command line switches to assign values to variables to replace the constants 'Failure Limit'
                    -F * number of pings to fail before full reset (default $PINGRESET)

2021.02.23.01   Enh: new command line switches to assign values to variables to replace the constants 'Seconds between Tests'
                    -S * seconds to delay between ping tests (default $PINGSECS)


0.6.4 2/22/2021

2021.02.22.01   Bug: -x makes things go rather awry when my SBR loses connection and everything restarts, if you run with -x
                     - The conditionals on line 515 and 584 that test TCPLOG don't work. [[ -n TCPLOG ]] should be [[ -n "$TCPLOG" ]] two places.

                updated but not released 9/29/2020.
2020.09.29.01   Doc: restore correct ordering of log files for upload!
                     - cat $x.3 $x.2 $x.1 $x.0 $x > t.log   # was cat $x $x.0 $x.1 $x.2 $x.3
                     - Order was reversed just before release by review error.

2020.09.25.02   Doc: tcp logging solution for Windows.
                     - was done 0.6.3, 'ncat' from nmap.org, not listed.


0.6.3 9/25/2020

2020.09.24.02   Doc: Add script example for deidentification
                     - new section "Uploading Log Files"

2020.09.25.03   Enh: Always begin incidents with record separator in local log file.
                     - LogFile_save "RS" adds the record separator

2020.09.24.01   Doc: Add script example to upload local log files to desktop.
                     - new sections "Uploading Local Log Files to the Desktop" and "Log File Analysis"

2020.09.18.02   Enh: Replace ugly-looking log level conditionals with a debug echo (decho ?) function.
                     - e.g., decho 3 "Send Successful" # seems to work.

2020.09.17.02   Enh: Implement wlan restart before ping fails when Bit Rate falls below a specified threshold for a period of time.
                     - Cxl, too little too late, not effective, complexity not worth a 2 second gain.

2020.09.17.04   Enh: Implement automatic upload of local managed log to logging server when connected.
                     - Cxl, local rotated or pruned log files make this less important


0.6.2 9/23/2020

2020.09.22.03   Bug: -r option collision
                    -R )    RestartNetwork

2020.09.22.02   Bug: Repeated multiple entries into ERRLOGLAST if the nc transmission fails
                     - Use DTEND variable to write only one recovery entry to ERRLOGLAST

2020.09.22.01   Bug: Link Statistics preceeds failure incident in log file. nc log file correct.
                     This occurs because the statistics are saved immediately to the log file, but the
                     failure and reconnection report are saved only after reconnection...
                     - Split these. Save the failure report immediately to log file, reconnect saved when reconnected.


0.6.1 9/22/2020

2020.09.22.04   Doc: new "Modifying the Script" section
                    - discussion of default values, and hard-coded constants,

0.5.2 9/21/2020

2020.09.21.02   Enh: add access point scan results to error logs, to test the theory that the wireless is loses the connection
                possibly because the connected access point is not found during a periodic scan.

2020.09.21.01   Enh: change options to match syslogd: sleep seconds to '-z' was -s, new log file size: -s, new max logs to keep: -b
                Not adopt: -n Run in foreground, -S Smaller logging output, -R HOST[:PORT] Log to IP or hostname on PORT (default PORT=514/UDP)
                -L Log locally and via network (default is network only if -R), -O FILE Log to given file (default:/var/log/messages)
                Similar: -l N  Set local log level
                -s SIZE Max size (KB) before rotate (default:50KB, 0=off)
                -b N    N rotated logs to keep (default:3, max=99, 'p'=trim )

2020.09.17.03   Enh: Implement actual local managed logging for local review with rotation.
                     - see 2020.09.21.01
                     - large change should have increased version number to 0.6.0, but did not.


0.5.1 9/19/2020

2020.09.19.10   Doc: manual.txt: ephemeral shell function pwp was pw.
2020.09.19.09   Doc: manual.txt: tcp logging server option is -t, not -l as in versions before 0.4.1.
2020.09.19.01   Enh: Add ping result to capture statistics.
                     - trimmed ping result added.
                     - needs more work.
2020.09.19.05   Enh: Consolidate large 'case' statement to fewer lines.
                     - done
2020.09.19.05   Enh: Add short version string to host name id for log parsing
                     - done e.g., "Playroom.53.051".
2020.09.19.03   Enh: Add last byte of radio's ip address to Hostname, e.g., "Playroom.53".
                     - done. IPLAST
2020.09.19.07   Fnc: Handle ip auto configuration address (e.g., 169.154) to prevent bogus gateway, etc.
                     - done. IPADDR, IPLAST
2020.09.19.06   Enh: Implement variable size circular buffer without arrays (ash)
                     - used 'eval' indirection to create separate variables to hold entries.


0.5.0 9/18/2020

2020.09.18.01   Enh: Pseudo circular buffer to hold relevant wlan performance data for inclusion into the PINGLOG for upload.
                     Trim data to just the minimum to keep size low. May need data every 1 or 2 seconds.
                     - Basic iwconfig data is collected every 2 seconds and saved in a fixed 8 slot circular buffer
                     - The buffer is saved to the file system when the link fails.
                     - The buffer is sent to the tcp logger when the link returns.
                     - New -vt testing option saves the buffer every 2x10=20 seconds, for an almost complete record.


0.4.2 9/18/2020

2020.09.18.04   Doc: Correct several "history.txt" citing the wrong install directory: /etc/wlanpoke/ was /etc/
                     Added instructions for ephemeral shell functions pw and ll
2020.09.18.03   Bug: hard coded /etc/ in
                    #if cat /etc/wlanerr.log | nc -w 3 $TCPLOG $TCPPORT     # 0.4.2: log no longer in /etc/, fails to send logs...!!!

2020.09.17.01   Add pid file to find and kill other instances, allowing only one instance.
                Done, let's see if it works!
o               Initial documentation and installation info.
o               Logging server option -t was -l. Log level option -l was -v. -v is available.
